DroidScript - JavaScript for Android! :-)

The project is very unfinished at this stage!

DroidScript (formerly called RhinoDroid) is a JavaScript programming tool for Android.
It is a tool for building full Android applications.

It is based on the Mozilla Rhino JavaScript implementation (which is why it was first 
called RhinoDroid).

The DroidScript application allows both editing and running programs on a device, 
and will add remote coding using a web application. The application contains a tiny 
web server that accepts HTTP PUT-requests with JavaScript code as its body.
But this is not yet complete.

How To

On startup, the app reads a JavaScript file: 
/sdcard/droidscript/DroidScriptMainActivity.js

Steps if using the emulator:
1) Create an SD card image with: mksdcard 512M sdcard.iso
2) Launch emulator with script: ./emulator.sh

Copy DroidScriptMainActivity.js to device with script: ./copyjs.sh

Import project into Eclipse, compile and run on emulator or device.
If you don't want to compile, DroidScript.apk is on GitHub in bin folder.
Install on device with: adb install -r DroidScript.apk

Again, everything is very experimental and unfinished at this stage.

Have fun!
