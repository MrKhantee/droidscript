Introduction

The project is very unfinished at this stage! Will commit a working version
over the next few days.

DroidScript (formely called RhinoDroid) is a JavaScript programming tool for Android.
It is a tool for building full Android applications.

It is based on the Mozilla Rhino JavaScript impementation (which is why it was first 
called RhinoDroid).

The DroidScript application allows both editing and running programs on a device, 
and remote coding using a web application. The application contains a tiny web server
that accepts HTTP PUT-requests whith JavaScript code as its body.

Everything is very experimental and unfinished at this stage.

Have fun!
